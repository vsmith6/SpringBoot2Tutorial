# SpringBoot2Tutorial
This is a tutorial by Frank Morely on LinkedIn that covers Spring Boot in detail.
Some concepts that were covered including connecting to a Postgre database and completing a RabbitMQ
consumer and producer.  This tutorial I did on a Windows computer, and I manually installed Postgre, creating the
DB tables from the postgre cli.  The Rabbit MQ I installed using Docker as that was easiest on a Windows machine.
There were some moderate configuration changes that are different from the tutorial that were necessary to run this
on a Windows computer, and also in Java 17.
